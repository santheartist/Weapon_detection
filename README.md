# 🔍 Weapon Detection System

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **Weapon Detection System** designed for real-time detection of weapons in video streams. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to identify potential threats and alert relevant authorities. The system is split into two main components:

1. **Server-Side Application**: Handles model inference and backend operations.
2. **Client-Side Application**: Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time detection.

---

## 📚 Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Uses YOLOv5 for high-speed and accurate weapon detection.
- **Modular Design**: Separates server and client functionalities for scalability.
- **User Alerts**: Generates alerts when a weapon is detected.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with various operating systems and devices.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
### Core Frameworks and Tools:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch (YOLOv5)
- **Backend**: Flask/Django (server-side)
- **Frontend**: React/HTML/CSS (client-side interface)

### Additional Tools:
- **OpenCV**: For real-time video processing
- **TensorFlow**: Optional model integrations
- **Database**: SQLite/MySQL (if required for logging events)
